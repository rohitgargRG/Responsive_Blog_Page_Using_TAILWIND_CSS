                    <span class="font-bold text-lg">His saga is the entrepreneurial creation myth</span> writ large: Steve Jobs cofounded Apple in his parent's garage in 1976, was ousted in 1985, returned to rescue it from near bankruptcy in 1997, and by the time he died, in October 2011, had built it into the world's most valuable company. Along the way he helped to transform seven industries: personel computing, animated movies, music ,phones, tablet computing,retail stores, and digital publishng. He thus belongs in the pantheon of America's great innovators, along with Thomas Edison, Henry Ford, and Walt Disney. None of these men was a saint,but long after their personalities are forgotten, history will remember how they applied imagination to tech and business.
